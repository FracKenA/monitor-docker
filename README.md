# op5-docker
> This is a basic example of how you might deploy OP5 Monitor via Docker. This is only a guide and several pre-configuration steps must be taken before this will work. You will need to build the docker image prior to use.

> This docker file is intended as an example to be used with an automation system like chef. To have a stand alone deployment of OP5 Monitor for a lab please use https://hub.docker.com/r/op5com/op5-monitor/

> **Please be aware OP5 does not support docker in production at this time.
